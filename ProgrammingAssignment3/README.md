HL7 Stuff AND R Programming Assignment 3
======================================================
This repo started out as a place for a Johns Hopkins Data Scientist course
I took on R programming.  One of the course assignments (in here) was to
interrogate some HL7 CSV data and produce some analysis.

This got me interested in HL7 again, so I am having a muck around with
some HL7v3 (and my own HL7v4) that I was sodding around with a few years
ago.

If any of my class mates are interested, I implemented the R routines
in SQL for comparison.

I mentioned this a few years ago, and was called mad then, but it seems Marky is ALWAYS right.  What I mentioned some years ago was that HL7 v3, since it was not finished, and had been under development for about 20 years, was never likely to be finished.

Four years onwards, HL7v3 is still in "BETA development".  Like everything else developed by a committee it has become big, fat, unwieldy, expensive and self perpetuating.

I said it then, and it is moreso true now.  HL7v3 is LONG obsolete before it gets close to being finished.

The data store is a tragically complex XML implementation, but more than that, the whole architecture is based on the CORBA/SOAP/XML model which apart from a few dusty gubbermint departments, has vanished from the face of the Earth.

The future of HL7 NEEDS to be RAPID development in a RESTFul architecture, and switching to JSON as a data store.

Anyone want to prototype HL7v4 with me?  This is as good a repo as any to start with.

Mail me and I'll stick you on the magic list.
